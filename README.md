# LinearRegressorFromScratch
Built a linear regressor class with fit and predict methods from scratch.
#Things i learnt:
1.OOPS structure logic.
2.No need to add bias at every column.
3.How to initialize weights and matrix multiplication in python.
4.Logical structure of the code.
5.How the learning rate and epochs are tweaked.
